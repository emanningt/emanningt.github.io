For my JavaScript Project I created an App to create a game where users can name there game, add players and keep track of there scores. Jumping right into JS was tough but it was great learining how to minipulate the DOM. Here I'm going to share some of the things I learned throught the prosses. 

First the DOM... What the heck is that!? 

Well to start DOM stands for Document Object Model. The way I have heard this best described is "The browser's internal programmatic reprsentation of the web page.". This basicly means you can use JavaScript to minipulate the DOM withought actually changing the HTML thats already there. 

To give some examoles of Document Object Model it would look something like this:

```
document.getElementById(id)

document.getElementByTagName(tag)

document.createElement(name)

```

This is just some vanila JavaScript.
